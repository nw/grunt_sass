## Grunt / Sass basic project example

### Setup

One time setup

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
git clone https://github.com/nw/grunt_sass.git
cd grunt_sass
npm install
```

### Running

```
grunt
```

This will run forever. You can use `Ctrl-C` to exit. Anytime you save a change to any `scss` file in `src/sass` css will automatically be built.

There is currently an `example.scss` file to demonstrate. 


### Explanation

* To keep things clean I located all the `scss` (sass) files in `src/sass`.
* CSS is generated and put into directory `public/css`
* git ignore is added to the `public/css` directory so you don't check in your generated css code. You only check in your source code.
* `Gruntfile.js` has a few options that can be tweaked based on what you want:
** `style`: currently set to `expanded` but `nested`, `compact` & `compressed` are valid.
** lineNumber: `true` outputs the line number from the `sass` file that generated the css. Helpful when learning or debugging.
